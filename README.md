# Get Current Weather in React via WeatherAPI

<p>I am practicing and improving my skills in front end development.  My framework(?) of choice is Reactjs.  After much time spent learning, I needed to start doing some things on my own.</p>

<p>I settled upon building web apps with Reactjs and WeatherAPI (a free API on RapidAPI.com).  This is the first iteration.  It gets current weather for any specific US zip code.  There is some use of CSS to 'pretty it up', but not much.</p>

<p>I will begin posting some more repos similar to this one as my lesson plan right now is to just write one API front end after another until I can do so with very little 'StackOverflow use'.</p>

<p>Other than what I obtained through WeatherAPI, all the code is mine.  You are free to borrow and use as will, as long as you give credit where credit is due. Use at your own risk.</p>
